	abstract = {A wealth of protein and DNA sequence data is being generated by genome projects and other sequencing efforts. A crucial barrier to deciphering these sequences and understanding the relations among them is the difficulty of detecting subtle local residue patterns common to multiple sequences. Such patterns frequently reflect similar molecular structures and biological properties. A mathematical definition of this "local multiple alignment" problem suitable for full computer automation has been used to develop a new and sensitive algorithm, based on the statistical method of iterative sampling. This algorithm finds an optimized local alignment model for N sequences in N-linear time, requiring only seconds on current workstations, and allows the simultaneous detection and optimization of multiple patterns and pattern repeats. The method is illustrated as applied to helix-turn-helix proteins, lipocalins, and prenyltransferases.},

analysis and prediction of DNA binding sites. This problem can be conveniently divided into two subproblems. The first is, given a collection of known binding sites, develop a representation of those sites that can be used to search new sequences and reliably predict where additional binding sites occur. The second is, given a set of sequences known to contain binding sites for a common factor, but not knowing where the sites are, discover the location of the sites in each sequence and a representation for the specificity of the

	abstract = {The ability to determine important features within DNA sequences from the sequences alone is becoming essential as large-scale sequencing projects are being undertaken. We present a method that can be applied to the problem of identifying the recognition pattern for a DNA-binding protein given only a collection of sequenced DNA fragments, each known to contain somewhere within it a binding site for that protein. Information about the position or orientation of the binding sites within those fragments is not needed. The method compares the "information content" of a large number of possible binding site alignments to arrive at a matrix representation of the binding site pattern. The specificity of the protein is represented as a matrix, rather than a consensus sequence, allowing patterns that are typical of regulatory protein-binding sites to be identified. The reliability of the method improves as the number of sequences increases, but the time required increases only linearly with the number of sequences. An example, using known cAMP receptor protein-binding sites, illustrates the method.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors and histone modifications are crucial regulators of gene expression that mutually influence each other. We present the DNA binding profiles of upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 (USF1, USF2) and acetylated histone H3 (H3ac) in a liver cell line for the whole human genome using ChIP-chip at a resolution of 35 base pairs. We determined that these three proteins bind mostly in proximity of protein coding genes transcription start sites (TSSs), and their bindings are positively correlated with gene expression levels. Based on the spatial and functional relationship between USFs and H3ac at protein coding gene promoters, we found similar promoter architecture for known genes and the novel and less-characterized transcripts human mRNAs and spliced ESTs. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a previously underestimated abundance of genes in a bidirectional conformation, where USFs are bound in between TSSs. After taking into account this promoter conformation, the results indicate that H3ac is mainly located downstream of TSS, and it is at this genomic location where it positively correlates with gene expression. Finally, USF1, which is associated to familial combined hyperlipidemia, was found to bind and potentially regulate nuclear mitochondrial genes as well as genes for lipid and cholesterol metabolism, frequently in collaboration with GA binding protein transcription factor alpha (GABPA, nuclear respiratory factor 2 [NRF-2]). This expands our understanding about the transcriptional control of metabolic processes and its alteration in metabolic disorders.},
